## Project Overview

An all-in-one internal web app for HD Hauling & Grading (paving contractor) — proposals, CRM, pipeline, scheduling, work orders, job costing, reporting, admin. Built with a Flask backend and a fully self-contained single-file frontend (`index.html`). Deployed on Railway, source on GitHub, database on Supabase.

## Infrastructure

| Resource | Value |
|---|---|
| **Live URL** | https://web-production-e19b3.up.railway.app |
| **GitHub Repo** | https://github.com/niewdel/hd-app |
| **Supabase Project** | azznfkboiwayifhhcguz |
| **Supabase URL** | https://azznfkboiwayifhhcguz.supabase.co |
| **Railway** | Auto-deploys from GitHub `main` branch |

### Supabase Direct Access
Bug reports and other DB tables can be queried directly via the Supabase REST API. The service role key is stored in the memory file `reference_supabase_access.md`. Use it like:
```bash
curl -s "https://azznfkboiwayifhhcguz.supabase.co/rest/v1/TABLE_NAME?select=*" \
  -H "apikey: SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```
To update a record: `PATCH` to `...rest/v1/TABLE_NAME?id=eq.ID` with JSON body.

### Deployment
- Push to GitHub `main` branch → Railway auto-deploys (~60 seconds)
- Flask serves `index.html` as a static file from the root route `/`
- All other routes are API endpoints

## Frontend (`index.html`) — Architecture

### Single-File Design
The entire frontend is one HTML file. All CSS, JS, and HTML in one file. No build step, no bundler. This is intentional — keeps deployment simple.

### Panels (navigation sections)
| Panel ID | Description |
|---|---|
| `panel-dashboard` | Dashboard — KPIs, weather, today's schedule, reminders, leads, recent activity |
| `panel-build` | Proposal builder with pricing options |
| `panel-project` | Single project detail view |
| `panel-projects` | Projects list + pipeline (Kanban) |
| `panel-contacts` | Clients + Subcontractors tabs |
| `panel-schedule` | Calendar views (day/3-day/week/month) |
| `panel-co` | Change order form |
| `panel-reports` | Reporting module |
| `panel-settings` | Settings — materials, crew, equipment, company info |
| `panel-admin` | Admin — user management, activity log, archived items |
| `panel-bugs` | Bug reports tab |
| `panel-roadmap` | Product roadmap tab |
| `panel-workorder` | Work order detail view |

### Authentication Flow
1. Page loads → startup IIFE calls `/auth/check`
2. If authenticated: hides login screen, shows app, calls `boot()`, then `showAdminElements()`
3. If not: shows login screen with canvas animation
4. `doLogin()` → POST `/auth/login` with `{username, password}` → on success: set `window._userRole`, call `boot()`, `showAdminElements()`
5. `doLogout()` → POST `/auth/logout` → `location.reload()`
6. Users have username + password (min 6 chars). Passwords are SHA-256 hashed server-side and stored in `pin_hash` column.
7. Three roles: `admin`, `user`, `field`. Field users see a reduced UI (elements with `data-field-hidden` are hidden).

### Admin Nav Visibility
- `nav-admin` element has `data-admin-hidden` attribute by default
- CSS: `[data-admin-hidden]{display:none}`
- `showAdminElements()` calls `removeAttribute('data-admin-hidden')` on all `[data-admin-hidden]` elements
- **Critical**: `boot()` crashes if called when sections/DOM aren't ready — wrapped in `try/catch` so `showAdminElements()` always runs after

### Key Global Variables
```js
window._userRole      // 'admin' or 'user'
window._userName      // full name
window._userUsername  // username
window._adminUsers    // {id: userObject} map for edit modal

// Pricing data
MAT        // {material: costPerTon} — editable in Settings
MAT_DEFAULT // original defaults (for reset)
LBS        // {material: lbsPerTon} — hidden, not shown in UI
DRATE      // {material: defaultBidRate}
DDEPTH     // {material: defaultDepth}
LBADGE     // {material: badgeCssClass}
LTYPES     // array of material names

// Concrete types
CTYPES     // [{id, name, desc, unit, cy_per_lf}]
           // cy_per_lf = cubic yards per linear foot

// Badge definitions
BADGE_DEFS // {cssClass: {label, color}} — editable in Settings

// Bid Items Library
BID_LIBRARY  // [{id, name, desc, unit, rate}] — persisted in localStorage
_libId       // auto-increment counter for library items

// Job cost
jcCrewRate      // crew day rate ($)
jcOverheadPct   // overhead %
jcProductivity  // tons/day (note: variable name is jcProductivity, NOT productivity)

// Proposal state
sections    // pavement sections array
concItems   // concrete items array
extraItems  // additional items array [{id, name, desc, qty, unit, price, subtotal}]
```

### Material Pricing System
- Materials stored in `MAT` object (cost $/ton) — editable in Settings
- `LBS` stores density (lbs/ton) — used internally for tonnage calc, NOT shown in UI
- `DRATE` stores default bid rates, `DDEPTH` stores default depths
- `LBADGE` maps material name → CSS badge class
- `renderMatTable()` renders the settings table — all rows are deletable including defaults
- Density column intentionally removed from UI (still used in calculations)

### Concrete CY Calculation
```js
// cy_per_lf values per concrete type:
// 18" Standard C&G: 0.028, 24": 0.037, 30": 0.046
// 6" Vertical Curb: 0.012, 6" Mountable: 0.012
// Valley Gutter: 0.049, Ribbon Curb: 0.019
// Concrete Flume: 0.019, Thickened Edge: 0.009

function calcConcCY(item) {
  // returns cubic yards = qty * cy_per_lf
}
```
CY is displayed in green next to each concrete row result.

### Settings Panel Cards (in order)
1. **Sender Information** — name, email, phone for proposal header
2. **Job Cost Defaults** — crew day rate, overhead %, productivity (t/day)
3. **Material Prices** — editable table (cost, rate, depth, badge) + delete all rows
4. **Layer Badges** — add/remove/rename badge types (Base, Binder, Surface, Millings, Concrete)
5. **Bid Items Library** — reusable line items with descriptions

### Bid Items Library
- Stored in `localStorage` key `hd_bid_library`
- `renderLibraryList()` — renders in Settings
- `openLibraryPicker()` — modal picker in Build Proposal
- Clicking "Insert" in picker adds item to `extraItems` with name, desc, unit, price pre-filled

### Additional Items (Extra Items)
- Each item has: `{id, name, desc, qty, unit, price, subtotal}`
- Description field added (`updExtraDesc()` function)
- "From Library" button opens `openLibraryPicker()` modal
- `renderExtra()` built with DOM API (not innerHTML strings) to avoid escaping issues

### Login Page
- Full-screen black background with animated red particle network canvas (`initLoginCanvas()`)
- Canvas: 60 nodes drifting, connected with red lines when within 160px
- White top bar with HD logo
- "HD HAULING & GRADING" title: `font-size:30px`, red, letter-spaced
- Username + PIN fields, ACCESS TOOL button

### Admin Panel
- **User Management tab**: table of all users, Edit button for all (including self), Deactivate for others only
- **Activity Log tab**: timestamped logins with IP, filterable by user
- Edit user modal uses `window._adminUsers[id]` lookup (not JSON.stringify inline) to avoid escaping issues with special chars in names

## Known Issues & Important Notes

### ⚠️ File Editing Warning
**Do NOT edit `index.html` using string concatenation or template literals with mixed quote styles.** All previous corruption was caused by this. Always use:
- DOM API (`createElement`, `addEventListener`) for dynamic content
- Simple string replacements with consistent quote style
- Test with `src.includes('functionName')` before pushing

### ⚠️ boot() Error Handling
`boot()` is wrapped in `try/catch` in both the doLogin and auth/check paths because `renderJCDefaults()` can throw if called before the DOM is ready. `showAdminElements()` must always run AFTER boot(), even if boot throws.

### ⚠️ Variable Name: `jcProductivity`
The productivity variable is `jcProductivity` — NOT `productivity`. Using `productivity` causes a ReferenceError that crashes `boot()`.

### ⚠️ Admin Nav
Uses `data-admin-hidden` attribute + CSS `[data-admin-hidden]{display:none}`. Do NOT use inline `style.display=''` (empty string) to show it — this clears the inline style but the CSS class rule still hides it. Use `removeAttribute('data-admin-hidden')` instead.

### ⚠️ Pushing to GitHub
The only safe way to push is via the GitHub Contents API with proper base64 encoding:
```js
const bytes = new TextEncoder().encode(src);
let bin = '';
for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) bin += String.fromCharCode(bytes[i]);
const b64 = btoa(bin);
// Verify roundtrip before pushing:
const rt = new TextDecoder('utf-8').decode(Uint8Array.from(atob(b64), c => c.charCodeAt(0))) === src;
```
Always verify roundtrip. Never use `btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(src)))` — causes file doubling.

### renderExtra() and renderBadgeList()
These functions MUST use the DOM API, not innerHTML string building. Previous versions using HTML strings caused `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier` that broke the entire app.

LBS = {'ABC base':150, 'Mill & Pave':115, 'B25.0C':115, 'I19.0C':115, 'S9.5B':115, 'S9.5C':115}
```

## Bug Report Workflow

Bug reports are stored in the `hd_bug_reports` table in Supabase and viewed in the app's Bug Reports tab.

### How to read bug reports
Query the Supabase REST API directly:
```bash
curl -s "https://azznfkboiwayifhhcguz.supabase.co/rest/v1/hd_bug_reports?select=*&order=submitted_at.desc" \
  -H "apikey: SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -H "Authorization: Bearer SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```
Filter by status: append `&status=eq.Open` to the URL.

### How to mark a bug as fixed
After fixing a bug, ALWAYS update its status in Supabase:
```bash
curl -s -X PATCH "https://azznfkboiwayifhhcguz.supabase.co/rest/v1/hd_bug_reports?id=eq.BUG_ID" \
  -H "apikey: SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -H "Authorization: Bearer SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Prefer: return=minimal" \
  -d '{"status":"Fixed","admin_notes":"Description of what was fixed","resolved_at":"ISO_TIMESTAMP"}'
```
**This is mandatory.** Every bug fix must update the bug report status to "Fixed" with a note describing the fix.

## Pending / Future Work

- [ ] Phase tabs: multi-phase support partially built but not fully wired
- [ ] Badge Manager: dynamically inject CSS for custom badge colors
- [ ] Concrete items: allow custom `cy_per_lf` override per item

## Common Tasks

### Add a new API route
1. Edit `app.py`
2. Add route with `@app.route(...)` decorator
3. Use `@require_auth` or `@require_admin` decorator as needed
4. Push to GitHub → Railway redeploys

### Add a new settings card
1. Add HTML card div inside `#panel-settings` in `index.html`
2. Add JS render function (use DOM API, not innerHTML strings)
3. Call the render function from `showPanel()` when `name === 'settings'`
4. Persist to `localStorage` if user-editable

### Update material pricing defaults
Edit the `MAT`, `LBS`, `DRATE`, `DDEPTH`, `LBADGE` objects near line ~920 in `index.html`.

### Add a new concrete type
Add an entry to `CTYPES` array with `{id, name, desc, unit:'LF', cy_per_lf:X}`.

### Create a new user
Use the Admin panel in the app, or POST to `/admin/users` with `{username, full_name, password, role}`.
Required fields: `full_name`, `username`, `password` (min 6 chars). Optional: `email`, `phone`, `role`.

### Fix a bug report
1. Read bug reports from Supabase (see Bug Report Workflow section)
2. Fix the code
3. Update the bug status to "Fixed" in Supabase with admin_notes (MANDATORY)
4. Commit and push
